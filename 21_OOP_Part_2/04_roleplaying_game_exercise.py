# Roleplaying Game Classes
# Let's pretend we're building an RPG (roleplaying game) in Python. Side note: check out these games actually built in Python!

# 1. Define a base class "Character" that has the following properties:

# name  - String
# hp  - an Integer value representing health (aka hitpoints)
# level  - an integer value representing experience level
# 2. Define a subclass "NPC" (which stands for Non-Player Character) that inherits from Character , and has an additional instance method called speak  which prints the speech that character would say when a player interacts with them. 

# Example:

# villager = NPC("Bob", 100, 12)
# villager.name  # Bob
# villager.hp  # 100
# villager.level  # 12
# villager.speak()  # "I heard there were monsters running around last night!".

class Character:
    def __init__(self, name, hp, level):
        self.name = name
        self.hp = hp
        self.level = level

class NPC(Character):
    def __init__(self, name, hp, level):
        super().__init__(name, hp, level)
    
    def speak(self):
        return f"I heard there were monsters running around last night!"


villager = NPC("Bob", 100, 12)
print(villager.name)  # Bob
print(villager.hp)  # 100
print(villager.level)  # 12
print(villager.speak())  # "I heard there were monsters running around last night!".

# Writing Your Own Lambda!
# Write a lambda that accepts a single number and cubes it. Save it in a variable called cube .

# cube(2)  # 8

# cube(3)  # 27

# cube(8)  # 512

# This challenge has tests ensuring that cube  is a lambda rather than a function, so don't cheat and make it a plain old function :) 

cube = lambda a: a** 3

print(cube(2))
print(cube(3))
print(cube(8))

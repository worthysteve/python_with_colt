# Map Time Exercise
# Write a function called decrement_list  that accepts a single list of numbers as a parameter.  It should return a copy of the list where each item has been decremented by one. Use map to do this! For example:

# decrement_list([1,2,3])   #[0,1,2]

# decrement_list([20,14,11])  #[19,13,10]

# Tips:

# Remember map doesn't return a list on its own.  decrement_list , however, should return a list.
# You can either pass map another name function or use a lambda.  A lambda is preferable, even if it is a little scary looking.

def decrement_list(nums): return list(map(lambda a: a-1, nums))

print(decrement_list([1,2,3]))
print(decrement_list([20,14,11]))

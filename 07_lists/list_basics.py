# Lists Basics Exercise
# Now that we've learned about lists, let's get some practice. See the problem statements in the comments below:

# Initially create an empty list called instructors
instructors = []
# Add the following strings to the instructors list 
    # "Colt"
    # "Blue"
    # "Lisa"
instructors.extend(["Colt", "Blue", "Lisa"])

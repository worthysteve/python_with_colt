# 1. Given two lists [1,2,3,4] and [3,4,5,6], create a variable called answer, which is a new list that is the intersection of the two. Your output should be [3,4] .  Hint: use the in  operator to test whether an element is in a list.  For example:  5 in [1,5,2]  is True.  3 in [1,5,2]  is False.

# 2. Given a list of words ["Elie", "Tim", "Matt"] create a variable called answer2, which is a new list with each word reversed and in lower case (use a slice to do the reversal!) Your output should be ['eile', 'mit', 'ttam']

answer = [num for num in [1,2,3,4] if num in [3,4,5,6]]
print(answer)

answer2 = [val[::-1].lower() for val in ["Elie", "Tim", "Matt"]]
print(answer2)

# For Loop and Range Exercise
# Use a for loop to add up every odd number from 10 to 20 (inclusive) and store the result in the variable x .  

# You could cheat and just figure this out using a calculator, but...that would defeat the whole point of this course.

# Can I put emoji in here? Let's see...ðŸ¤— It works!!!

# Add up all odd numbers between 10 and 20
# Store the result in x:
x = 0

# YOUR CODE GOES HERE:
for num in range(11, 21, 2):
    x += num
    print(x)

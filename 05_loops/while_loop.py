# While Loop Exercise
# While loops are really hard for me to write tests for(until we learn about things like lists), so this exercise is a bit tricky to explain. :(   Here's the main idea:

# Use a while loop to generate a random number between 1 and 10 until you get the number 5. Every time the loop runs, increment the variable i .

# Here are more detailed steps:

# Generate a random number between 1 and 10 using randint(1, 10) , storing the result in the number variable
# Write a while loop to keep regenerating a new random number between 1 and 10 while the random number is not equal to 5.
# In order for my tests to work, please add 1 to i  each time through the loop.  My tests use this variable to check how many times your loops runs.

from random import randint

number = 0
i = 0
while number != 5:
    i += 1
    number = randint(1, 10)
    print(i, number)
